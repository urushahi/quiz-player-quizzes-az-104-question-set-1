    "explanation": "Azure VNet peering has the following rules:\n\n1. **Address spaces cannot overlap** — VNet-Corp (10.10.0.0/16) and VNet-Europe (10.10.0.0/16) have the **same** address space. Peering requires non-overlapping address spaces, so this peering would fail.\n\n2. **Cross-region peering is supported** (global VNet peering) — VNets in different regions can be peered, as long as other requirements are met.\n\n3. **VNet peering is NOT transitive** — Even if VNet-A is peered with VNet-B, and VNet-B is peered with VNet-C, VNet-A cannot communicate with VNet-C through VNet-B automatically. Each peering is an independent bilateral connection.\n\n4. **VNet-Trading (10.20.0.0/16) can peer with VNet-Europe (10.10.0.0/16)** — Their address spaces do not overlap, so this peering is valid regardless of them being in different regions.",
