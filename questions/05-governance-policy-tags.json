    "question": "Ridgepoint Financial has a resource group named **RG-Trading** that contains a virtual network named VNET-Trade. You assign the following Azure Policy to RG-Trading:\n\n- **Policy**: Require a tag and its value\n- **Effect**: Deny\n- **Tag name**: CostCenter\n- **Tag value**: Trading\n\nAfter assigning the policy, you apply the tag `CostCenter: Trading` to RG-Trading.\n\nYou then attempt to deploy a new virtual machine named VM-Analytics to RG-Trading **without specifying any tags on the VM**.\n\nWhat is the result?",
    "options": [
        {
            "text": "The deployment succeeds, and VM-Analytics inherits the CostCenter tag from RG-Trading",
            "correct": false
        },
        {
            "text": "The deployment is denied because VM-Analytics does not have the required CostCenter tag",
            "correct": true
        },
        {
            "text": "The deployment succeeds, but VM-Analytics has no tags",
            "correct": false
        },
        {
            "text": "The deployment succeeds, and the policy automatically adds the CostCenter tag to VM-Analytics",
            "correct": false
        }
    ],
    "explanation": "Azure Policy with the **Deny** effect blocks resource creation that does not comply with the policy rules. Since the policy requires every resource in RG-Trading to have the tag `CostCenter: Trading`, deploying a VM without that tag is denied.\n\nKey points:\n- **Tags are NOT inherited** from resource groups to resources. Each resource must have its own tags set explicitly.\n- The **Deny** effect prevents non-compliant resources from being created — it does not remediate or auto-tag.\n- If you wanted automatic tag inheritance, you would use the **Inherit a tag from the resource group** policy with a **Modify** effect instead.",
