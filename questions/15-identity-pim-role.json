    "question": "You manage the Microsoft Entra tenant for your organization. The tenant uses Microsoft Entra ID Premium P2 licensing. You need to add the **Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management** (PIM) application to the tenant so that privileged role assignments can be managed with just-in-time access.\n\nThe tenant contains the following administrators:\n\n| User | Role |\n|---|---|\n| AdminA | Global Administrator |\n| AdminB | Security Administrator |\n| AdminC | User Administrator |\n| AdminD | Billing Administrator |\n\nWhich user account can enable and configure PIM?",
    "options": [
        {
            "text": "AdminB (Security Administrator)",
            "correct": false
        },
        {
            "text": "AdminA (Global Administrator)",
            "correct": true
        },
        {
            "text": "AdminC (User Administrator)",
            "correct": false
        },
        {
            "text": "AdminD (Billing Administrator)",
            "correct": false
        }
    ],
    "explanation": "**Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management** requires a **Global Administrator** to initially consent to and enable the PIM application in a tenant. Once PIM is enabled, the Global Administrator becomes the first **Privileged Role Administrator** and can then delegate PIM management to others.\n\nThe Security Administrator role can view PIM data and reports but cannot enable or configure PIM initially. The User Administrator and Billing Administrator roles do not have permissions related to PIM at all.\n\nAfter initial setup, the **Privileged Role Administrator** role is sufficient to manage PIM without needing ongoing Global Administrator access.",
