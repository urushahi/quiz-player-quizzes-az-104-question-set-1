    "explanation": "To create an alert for VM CPU usage in Azure Monitor, you need:\n\n1. **A metric alert rule** — This defines the condition to monitor (CPU percentage > 80%) and the scope (VMs in the specific resource group). Metric alerts evaluate metrics at regular intervals.\n\n2. **An action group** — This defines who gets notified when the alert fires and how (email, SMS, webhook, etc.). An alert rule without an action group will fire but won't notify anyone.\n\n**Why not the other options:**\n- **Log Analytics workspace** — Not required for metric alerts on basic VM metrics like CPU, which are platform metrics already available. It's needed for custom log queries.\n- **Activity log alert** — Monitors Azure control plane operations (resource creation, deletion, etc.), not VM performance metrics\n- **Service health alert** — Monitors Azure service status and planned maintenance, not individual resource metrics",
