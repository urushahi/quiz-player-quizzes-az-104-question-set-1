    ],
    "explanation": "Azure Load Balancer has different requirements based on SKU:\n\n**Standard Load Balancer (LB-Internal):**\n- Backend pool membership is highly flexible. VMs can be standalone, in different availability sets, or in virtual machine scale sets.\n- Supports zone-redundant configurations.\n- VMs can be in different virtual networks (within the same region or via peering/global VNet support).\n\n**Basic Load Balancer (LB-Public):**\n- Backend pool VMs must be in the **same virtual network**.\n- If VMs are in an availability set or scale set, all VMs in that set must be in the backend pool.\n- Does not support cross-VNet or zone-redundant scenarios.\n\nNeither SKU requires VMs to run the same OS or be in the same resource group. Standard LB removed many of the strict membership constraints found in the Basic SKU.",
