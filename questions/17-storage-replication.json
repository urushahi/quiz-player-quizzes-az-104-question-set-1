    "explanation": "A **live migration** to ZRS has specific requirements:\n\n- The storage account must be **StorageV2 (GPv2)** or **FileStorage** kind\n- The account must currently use **LRS** replication (you cannot directly migrate from GRS to ZRS)\n- The region must support ZRS\n\nEvaluating each account:\n- **stlogistics01** ✅ — StorageV2 + LRS → eligible for ZRS live migration\n- **stlogistics02** ❌ — StorageV2 but uses GRS, not LRS. Must first change to LRS, then migrate to ZRS\n- **starchive03** ❌ — BlobStorage kind is a legacy type that does not support ZRS\n- **stpremium04** ❌ — BlockBlobStorage (Premium) supports ZRS in some regions but live migration is not supported for premium accounts; you must create a new account\n\nLive migration is an online process handled by Microsoft — your data remains available during the migration.",
